# About the Hackathon

## What is the purpose of the Hackathon?

- Build a collaborative community of early career researchers with interests in biostats/ data science/ AI
- Introduce this community to wider HRfH stakeholders – patients, clinicians, other HRfH researchers
- Tackle difficult and important challenges in HRfH time series data
- Generate reusable code
- During the three days, you will work in small groups to address two challenges in the area of tracked daily symptoms for people living with long-term conditions.

## Who can apply?

We aim to recruit 20 participants for an in-person session. The participants will include:

Early career researchers (e.g., PhD students, postdoctoral researchers) from academic or industrial background specializing in health data research.



## How much will it cost me to attend?

The registration fee is £50. Participants are responsible for arranging and covering the cost of their own transport and accommodation. A limited number of bursaries are available as we don’t want finances to be a barrier to attending. Please [contact us](mailto:hrfh@manchester.ac.uk) for further details.

## Cancellations

Participants should ensure they have adequate personal insurance for any pre-booked travel, as HRfH cannot refund any incurred costs in the event of an unavoidable cancellation. The registration fee is refundable only if cancelled at least two weeks before the event.
